## Project 1: Some totally rad stuff

**Project description:** The Darien Gap is an area of forest between Panama and Colombia. Unlike other regions of South and Central America, it is not traversed by the Pan-American Highway. However, migrants often trek through it to go north. This can often be very dangerous given the isolation. Mapping the routes commonly taken through the Darrien Gap might give some insight as to what paths are safest. 
(Not sure where to get data on this though?)
