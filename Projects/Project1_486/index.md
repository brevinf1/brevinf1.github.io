## Project 1: Some totally rad stuff

**Project description:** 
This project will attempt to map how temperature and the elderly population are distributed across the United States. This will be done using isotherms to represent areas of similar temperature and a chloropleth to symbolize elderly population. If there is a relationship between the elderly population and temperature, it may warrant concern given their vulnerability in heat waves.
### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques
