You can use the editor on GitHub to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/evanca/quick-portfolio/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
